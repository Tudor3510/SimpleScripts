The available options for IPv6 Auto Configuration are Stateless and Stateful. There is also an option to disable Router Advertisement (RA). However, I am not entirely sure how this works. For example, when I set the mode to Stateless and disabled Router Advertisement, my Android device was unable to obtain an IPv6 address.
For the IPv6 WAN connection, you can manually configure up to three DNS servers. However, client devices will only receive one DNS server, which is the LAN IPv6 address of the router (not the link-local address).
Regarding the gateway's link-local address, it is not fe80::1. Instead, the router generates it using a format that appears to be derived from its MAC address (starting with fe80::).

In contrast, for IPv4 WAN settings, you can manually configure up to two DNS servers.
